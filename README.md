# Vocabulary: The Gathering

Vocabulary: The Gathering is a resource that allows the user a place to create and store vocabulary cards based on the Magic:The Gathering TCG

# Motivation
There are a lot of terms in MTG, too many.
I needed a place where I could store new terminology that allowed me to quickly reference it and then delete it when I felt I knew it well enough.

# Tech used
Vanilla JS
HTML
SCSS
Google Firebase

# Features
This app features:
-A container that renders vocabulary cards specific to the user
-Two buttons on each card allowing the user to update or delete vocab cards
-Easy navigation through nav buttons
-An add term form allowing the user to create new vocabulary cards
-A search field that filters terms by name
-A by term type button that renders filter buttons
